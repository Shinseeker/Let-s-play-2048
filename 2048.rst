2048 is a single-player puzzle game created in March 2014 by 19-year-old Italian

on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048.

===========

2048 is played on a gray 4Ã—4 grid, with numbered tiles that slide smoothly 
when a player moves them using the four arrow keys. Every turn, a new tile 
will randomly appear in an empty spot on the board with a value of either 2 or 4.
